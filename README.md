This repository contains the code base for the work, *'[From Conflict to Cohesion: Structural Similarity Dampens Uncivil Discourse in Polarized Social Groups](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/740301)'*.

Authors: Matthew Yeaton, Sarayu Anshuman, Sameer Srivastava

**Input Data**
---
Input : The data consist of 5 million comments made on the Reddit platform by over 1.7 million users who are part of six groups (i.e., subreddits) that discuss such contentious topics as politics, cultural norms, science, and labor movements. The input data are first cleaned and processed.

*Note: The data have been modified to protect the data use agreements. Please note that author identifiers (e.g., “author0”) are not consistent across datasets. Each dataset was de-identified independently, so identical numeric labels do not imply the same underlying individual. This also applied to all the de-identified data columns.*

**Main Folders**

A description of the main folders in this repository. <br>
**<ins>Each folder has its own *README.md* file detailing the folder's contents.</ins>**

* *cross_sectional_analyses* folder : contains the codes for the main analyses
* *natural_experiment* folder : contains the codes for the natural experiment
* *misc_tables_figures* folder : contains additional codes for some tables and figures
* *robustness_checks* folder : contains codes for the supplemental analyses and robustness checks

**Order of Execution**
----

There is no fixed order of execution of the programs. The two main folders are the *cross_sectional_analyses* folder and the *natural_experiment* folder.
